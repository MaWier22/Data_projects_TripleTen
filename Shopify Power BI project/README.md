# üì¶ Shopify App Landscape Analysis

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview

This project analyzes the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to the success of Shopify apps and provide actionable insights to help stakeholders understand what drives high-quality apps in the marketplace.

**Dataset:**  
The `shopify.xlsx` dataset includes:  
- **apps:** Details about each app listed on the Shopify App Store.  
- **apps_categories:** Join table connecting apps to their respective categories.  
- **categories:** Descriptions of all available app categories (each app can belong to multiple categories).  
- **reviews:** Individual user reviews, including star ratings, comments, and developer responses if available.

**Key Visuals Built:**

- **KPI Card:** Displays the total unique number of apps available on Shopify.
- **Line Chart:** Shows the total number of reviews over time (`lastmod` date) to reveal trends in review activity.
- **Scatterplot:** Plots `reviews_count` on the X-axis and `average rating` on the Y-axis to show the relationship between popularity and app quality.  
  - *Observation:* Most apps cluster around high ratings (4‚Äì5 stars), with very few apps having low ratings.
- **Developer Bar Chart (Sum of Ratings):** Shows each developer‚Äôs total sum of ratings.  
  - *Note:* This can be misleading because a high sum can still mean many low-star reviews.
- **Developer Bar Chart (Helpful Reviews Average):** Shows average `helpful_review` scores for each developer to better indicate quality.
- **Developer Responsiveness Bar Chart:** Shows how many reviews developers respond to (`developer_answered`), filtered to only apps with over 500 reviews to highlight engagement for large-scale apps.

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

- The Shopify App Store has a high concentration of apps with strong average ratings, indicating overall quality in the marketplace.
- Apps with high review counts and consistently high ratings stand out as top performers. Example: An app with 24,780 reviews maintains an average rating of 4.6/5.
- Total sum of ratings can be misleading ‚Äî average `helpful_review` scores are a clearer measure of true app quality.
- Developer responsiveness is an important success factor; developers who engage with customer feedback tend to build more trust and higher ratings over time.

## üîç Recommendations

- **Showcase Top Performers:** Highlight apps with both high review counts and high average ratings to help merchants find proven, reliable apps.
- **Encourage Developer Engagement:** Promote developer best practices for responding to reviews and engaging with customers.
- **Use Quality Metrics Thoughtfully:** Prioritize average `helpful_review` scores over total ratings when ranking or featuring apps.
- **Monitor Trends:** Use time-based review trends to identify peak popularity periods and potential opportunities for new marketing or support.
- **Explore Categories:** Analyze which app categories deliver the best customer satisfaction to guide future investment and partnerships.
